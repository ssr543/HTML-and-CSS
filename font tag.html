        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
